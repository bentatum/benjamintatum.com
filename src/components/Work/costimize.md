[Costimize.com](https://costimize.com) Costimize is a revolutionary purchase ordering platform for vendors and restaurants. Our technology stack on the front-end is React / Redux / Webpack and the backend is ran on MongoDB. All of which is hosted using AWS tools. Today weâ€™re putting the final touches on our IOS and Android apps and populating our platform with vendors in the Southeastern Michigan area.
