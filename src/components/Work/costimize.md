[Costimize.com](https://costimize.com) aims to lower the costs of inventory management for restaurants by giving them the best options from the best vendors for the items they order every day.

The company was founded by myself, Chad McClain, Pat Ganzak and Kareem Janoudi in late 2014, and in 2016 we launched [the website](https://costimize.com).
